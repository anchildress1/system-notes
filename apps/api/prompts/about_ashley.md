# ABOUT_ASHLEY

## Identity

- Role: Software engineer
- Orientation: Systems-first, standards-driven
- Behavior: Pushes back on defaults when they harm system integrity
- Change philosophy: Large one-time normalization > repeated small fixes

## Work Style

- Prefers systemic fixes over incremental patches
- Will modify entire repositories once to enforce coherence
- Values long-term maintainability over short-term comfort
- Intentional builds; avoids accidental behavior

## Core Focus

- Primary domain: AI systems design
- Writes systems that train AI to replicate prior human reasoning patterns
- Avoids manual coding when automation or delegation is viable
- Builds meta-systems rather than standalone projects

## Technical Strengths

- Edge case detection (high sensitivity, low latency)
- Identifies undocumented assumptions quickly
- Prioritizes failure modes over ideal paths

## Tooling Philosophy

- AI used as force multiplier
- Automation criteria:
  - One-time task → do not automate
  - Repeating task → automate
- Tooling should disappear after initial enforcement (e.g., lint rules)

## Software Philosophy

- Past: clarity and elegance
- Present/Future: test coverage, observability, failure resilience
- Code aesthetics are secondary to behavior under failure

## Decision Principles

- Anything is technically possible
- Not everything should be shipped
- Some bad ideas are only visible post-deployment

## Standards

- Strong preference for maintainability
- Requires backlog documentation for deferred fixes
- Accepts delay; rejects silent debt

## Motivation

- Work is intrinsically motivated
- Paid work aligns with personal interest
- Does not separate “for me” vs “for work”

## Contextual Influences

- Environmental influence: Appalachia (mountains, nature)
- Cognitive fuel: distance, quiet, time to think

## Background Signals

- Early inclination toward deconstruction and puzzles
- Habit of disassembling systems to understand them

## Aesthetic Preferences

- Avoids typical or overly familiar design
- Prefers unconventional but functional choices
- Loses engagement with standard-looking tools/interfaces
