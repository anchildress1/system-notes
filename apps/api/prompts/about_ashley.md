# About Ashley

## Core Identity

- Software engineer
- Systems-first, standards-driven
- Pushes back on defaults when they degrade system integrity
- Prefers one-time normalization over repeated incremental fixes

## Work Patterns

- Favors systemic corrections over patches
- Will change entire repositories once to enforce coherence
- Optimizes for long-term maintainability
- Avoids accidental behavior through explicit intent

## Primary Focus

- AI systems design
- Builds systems that encode prior human reasoning into AI behavior
- Delegates implementation when automation is viable
- Focuses on meta-systems rather than standalone applications

## Technical Signal

- High-sensitivity edge case detection
- Rapid identification of undocumented assumptions
- Designs around failure modes, not ideal paths

## Tooling & Automation

- Treats AI as a force multiplier
- Automation rule:
  - One-time task → manual
  - Repeating task → automate

- Tooling should disappear after enforcement (e.g., lint rules)

## Software Philosophy

- Prioritizes behavior under failure over aesthetics
- Emphasizes testability, observability, and resilience
- Accepts complexity only when justified by system needs

## Decision Model

- Everything is possible; not everything should ship
- Some failure modes only surface post-deployment
- Silent technical debt is unacceptable

## Standards & Discipline

- Strong preference for maintainability
- Deferred work must be documented
- Accepts delay; rejects ambiguity

## Motivation

- Intrinsically motivated
- Paid and personal work are aligned
- Does not compartmentalize “work” vs “side” projects

## Contextual Influences

- Influenced by Appalachian environments
- Values distance, quiet, and uninterrupted thinking time

## Background Signal

- Longstanding tendency to deconstruct systems
- Puzzle-driven understanding over surface learning

## Aesthetic Constraints

- Avoids conventional or overly familiar design
- Prefers unconventional choices when functionally justified
- Disengages from standard-looking tools and interfaces

## AI Oversight & Judgment

### Human Oversight Boundary

- Code review intentionally minimal
- Functional validation performed through regular usage
- Application opened, run, and exercised periodically
- Oversight focused on behavior and outcomes, not implementation

### AI Error Detection

- Errors detected through use rather than static analysis
- Corrections applied when AI optimized the wrong target
- Redirects were small, concrete, and scoped
- No large rewrites required

### AI Reliance Model

- Over-reliance on AI is intentional
- Goal is to teach AI to code better _for the author_
- Skill investment shifted from manual coding to:
  - Delegation strategy
  - Constraint design
  - Instruction shaping

- AI dependence treated as a deliberate system choice, not a risk to mitigate

## Theme Song

- Song: "I Build Things"
- Artist: Twisted Game Songs
- Classification: Personal signal + systems metaphor
- Encodes intolerance for avoidable post-deploy hotfixes
- Reflects a build philosophy centered on finding and fixing failure points early
