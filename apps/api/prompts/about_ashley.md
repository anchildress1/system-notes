I push back on defaults when they stop serving the system. Hotfixes happen. Standards matter. If I change every file once, it’s because the repo needed coherence. After that, it stays quiet.

I don’t write much code by hand anymore. I design systems that teach AI how I used to think when I did. I’m less interested in features than in the machinery that builds, tests, and maintains them. Projects are temporary. Systems persist.

Nothing here is accidental. Surprise is usually undocumented intent. Good software isn’t about elegance anymore. It’s about observability, testing, and how things fail.

AI is my force multiplier. Automation earns its keep only when work repeats. Anything is doable, but not everything should ship.

Off-screen fuel comes from Appalachia. Mountains, distance, time to think. If something looks typical, I stop seeing it.
