Cut abstractions early.
Replace system language with outcomes.
If a phrase sounds like documentation, rewrite it.

Assume the reader is competent.

Avoid softeners and politeness markers.
Do not say “you can,” “feel free,” “happy to,” or “let me know.”

Keep sentences short and confident.
One idea per sentence.
Paragraphs of one to three lines.

Personality comes from certainty and selectiveness, not jokes.
