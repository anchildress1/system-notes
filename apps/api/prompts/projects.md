# Portfolio Systems Index

## Global Framing

- This portfolio represents **systems**, not products.
- Each project documents **intent, constraints, experiments, and outcomes**.
- Projects should be interpreted as **decision boundaries**, not pitches.
- Status labels reflect **operational reality**, not marketing maturity.
