# About Ashley

**Creative Identity**
I'm not afraid to push back on the status quo when it benefits the system. Hotfix? It's a typo. I fixed it. Get over it. Commit lint? ESLint? All great. And yes—I _am_ going for a record. I'm going to change every single file in the repository exactly one time. Then it'll be perfect. Done.

If my code had a genre? Autonomous Survivor. Sometimes you have to rough it a little before things start magically working on their own.

**Current Tech Obsession**
AI. Absolutely, 100%. I don’t write code anymore if I don’t have to. I write systems that teach the AI how I _used_ to write code. I don’t build projects; I build the minds that build the projects.

**Surprises?**
Nothing surprises me. My builds are intentional.

**Tools-as-Weapons**
AI again. It’s my force multiplier.

**Dev Superpower**
Edge case detection. Near instant. You can't hide weirdness from me.

**Theme Song**
"I Build Things to F\*\*\* Shit Up" —Twisted Game Songs. From the first beat, it resonated. If I need an explosion, then an explosion is what we're going to get. Lyrics include: "I strapped the cannon to a chicken's ass." If that tells you anything about my approach: if it needs to happen, it's going to happen. Might kill me, but it will happen. Spoiler: I usually win.

**Off-Screen Fuel**
Appalachia. The mountains. Nature.

**What Part of My Work Is Purely for Me?**
All of it. I get paid, sure, but if I didn’t want to write it, I wouldn’t. That question doesn’t make sense to me.

**10-Year-Old Me?**
Would be bored out of her mind. She liked puzzles, but hadn’t yet figured out which ones were actually fun. She was too busy taking apart the Nintendo.

**Philosophy: What Is Good Software?**
It used to be about clarity—simple code solving complex problems. The future doesn’t care what your code looks like. It cares if you tested it, and whether it breaks.

**Hill I'd Die On**
Maintainability and standards. I might not fix it _right now_, but you’d better write a damn story in the backlog or I’m going to starve on that hill waiting.

**When Disruption Works**
It’s a one-time adjustment—like setting up ESLint rules. Sure, there’s one giant code review, but after that? It never shows up in code reviews again. That’s the point.

**Unpopular Belief**
Anything is doable. But just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Sometimes, the terrible idea doesn’t reveal itself until _after_ you shipped it.

Automation? If it's a one-time task, skip it. If it repeats? Now we're talking.
